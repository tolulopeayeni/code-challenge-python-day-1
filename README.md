# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

```text
One for X, one for me.
```

Where X is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name    |String to return 
|:-------|:------------------
|Alice   |One for Alice, one for me. 
|Bob     |One for Bob, one for me.
|        |One for you, one for me.
|Zaphod  |One for Zaphod, one for me.

# Tips

Before you start, make sure you understand how to write code that can pass the test cases.
For more context, check out this [tutorial](https://github.com/exercism/java/blob/master/exercises/hello-world/TUTORIAL.md).

This python exercises include multiple test cases. These cases are structured to
support a useful process known as
[test-driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
TDD involves repeating a structured cycle that helps programmers build complex
functionality piece by piece rather than all at once. That cycle can be
described as follows:

1. Add a test that describes one piece of desired functionality your code is
currently missing.
2. Run the tests to verify that this newly-added test fails.
3. Update your existing code until:
    - All the old tests continue to pass;
    - The new test also passes.
4. [Clean up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) your code, making
sure that all tests continue to pass. This typically involves renaming
variables, removing duplicated chunks of logic, removing leftover logging, etc.
5. Return to step 1 until all desired functionality has been built!

The test files in this track contain _all_ the tests your solution should pass
to be considered valid. That doesn't immediately seem to be compatible with the
cycle described above, in which tests are written one by one. However, we use python builtin [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module to write all test cases.


# Running the tests
You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal:

```sh
$ pytest
```
